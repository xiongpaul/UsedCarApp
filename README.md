This was the fourth and final assignment in my software quality assurance class from college.

This project features a very rudimentary and basic web app that served the purpose of a pseudo database of used car listings using HTML, JavaScript and CSS with input being handled by a web form. It would allow a user to enter information about their vehicle for sale then link the user and/or potential buyers to the associated JD Power and Associates page for that particular year, make and model of vehicle.

This project also executes system tests on the web app, by way of Selenium and the NUnit framework. We were instructed to use the Selenium IDE to create tests, and then modify the auto generated test code to issue the proper Assert exceptions if the test failed.

Hardly a challenging assignment, I think this one was supposed to teach us about the Selenium IDE and how it could work concurrently with the nUnit framework to create automated tests for a web application.
